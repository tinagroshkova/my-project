                <p>Finding the best foundation for your complexion can seem an impossible task. Do you want full coverage or light coverage? Matte or dewy? Cool or warm undertones? And what's the best way of finding your perfect shade amidst an overwhelming abundance of choice?</p>
                <p>When you do alight on the right fit, however, it's a true beauty game-changer. The correct foundation acts as a canvas for the rest of your make-up, concealing imperfections, unifying skin tone and creating a flawless finish. And from Giorgio Armani's barely-there Maestro to Fenty Beauty's mattifying Pro Filt'r and Chanel's glowy Les Beiges Healthy Glow Foundation, there's a formula to suit everyone, which explains why so many of them have achieved blockbuster status. </p>
                <p>When it comes to finding yours, consider your personal priorities before you shop. Do you prefer a dewy radiance or more of a velvet-matte finish? A full-coverage formula to keep you looking your best all day long, or a sheer wash of colour for a barely-there look that's more tint than foundation? Or, of course, both: who says you can't have a whole wardrobe of foundation products to suit your every need? </p>
                <p>And, as important, how best to apply them? A lot of the time it's about personal preference. A primer can smooth, blur fine lines and help foundation to stay on longer so it's a good first port of call and there's also the option of layering hydrating skincare beneath foundation to add a dewier effect. Depending on the finish you're after, consider the application method: fingers are great to create a natural finish as they warm the formula into the skin, while make-up brushes help blend seamlessly. </p>
                <p>Here, we've chosen the best foundation for every concern: formulas that meet the needs of women with a wide variety of skin types, colours and concerns. Discover Vogue's selection of the best foundation for putting your best face forward.</p>

                    <p><strong>Burberry Matte Glow Fluid Foundation</strong> </p>
                    <p class="entry-meta">Described as ‘life-proof’, this foundation is as durable as they come and will keep shine at bay for as long as is required. A matte glow might sound impossible, but that really is the finish it offers, evening out skin tone and brightening whilst it’s at it.</p>
