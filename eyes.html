                <p>Applying eyeshadow is relatively easy. However, learning to apply eye makeup the right way is no simple task. How do you choose the right shade for your eye color and skin tone? Do you really need 10 makeup brushes? Will you ever use every color in that eyeshadow palette?</p>
                <p>We know that it’s easy to get confused about the best ways to make your eyes pop, so we’ve crafted a 5-step guide to show you exactly how to handle all those eyeliners, mascaras, and shadows, no matter your eye shape or color. Let's get started:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Start with great makeup brushes.</strong></p>
                        <p>There’s a reason famous artists don’t finger paint: it’s much harder to create a masterpiece without the proper tools. The same holds true for makeup application. Invest in a few good cosmetic brushes for even, precise, and hygienic makeup application. Luckily, you can get great ones without dropping an entire paycheck.</p>
                        <p>When we tested the best makeup brushes in our Beauty Lab, we found that synthetic brushes are almost always preferable to their natural-fiber counterparts, and they are more affordable, easier to clean, and allergy-friendly. (Psst: All of our winners were synthetic, and the pros couldn’t differentiate them from pricier natural picks!)</p>
