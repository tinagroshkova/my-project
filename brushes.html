            <p>As much as the quality of makeup products matters, the brushes you use impact the overall result of your look as well. Although there are no rules in makeup, certain brushes work better for certain things, like how a big fluffy brush is better for applying powder rather than blending in foundation. Today, I am going to give y'all a list of brushes for each step of a full glam makeup routine that you can purchase!! </p>
            <p>We know that it’s easy to get confused about the best ways to make your eyes pop, so we’ve crafted a 5-step guide to show you exactly how to handle all those eyeliners, mascaras, and shadows, no matter your eye shape or color. Let's get started:</p>
            <p><strong>Foundation Brush:</strong> Typically, you would want a foundation brush that is dense so it doesn't soak up all the excess product. Good foundation brushes can be hard to come by because some can leave your makeup looking streaky. Majority of makeup lovers blend their foundation in with a makeup sponge, which works better than a brush. </p>
            <p><strong>Concealer:</strong> You can use the same brush that you did for your foundation, but instead of rubbing motions, use dabbing motions to get an even blend. Most artists prefer to utilize a sponge during this step as well, so I'm not going to link a product. </p>
            <p><strong>Powder/ Bronzer:</strong> Like I said in the intro, powder brushes are big fluffy brushes because if you use a dense brush, it is going to make you look all cakey and gross, which of course we don't want. I like to use my powder brush for my bronzer as well just to save myself the aggravation of having to wash more brushes. </p>
            <p><strong>Contour:</strong> Contouring is one of the only steps of a full glam makeup that you want to be somewhat harsh. To achieve this look, using a flat, dense brush will really pack a punch with a good contour shade. Just remember to blend it out so it doesn't look like you have a big line on your face. </p>
            <p><strong>Blush:</strong> The best blush brushes are smaller fluffy brushes that disperse the product without making it too harsh. Dense brushes are not ideal for blush because it would put way too much pigment on the cheeks. Angled contour brushes and mini fluffy brushes are the best for achieving a natural blushed cheek. </p>
            <p><strong>Highlighter:</strong> Similar to blush brushes, highlighter brushes need to be small, but somewhat dense. Highlighter is in a more concentrated area than say blush or bronzer, and you don't want your highlighter getting on parts of your face that you already powdered down. The Morphe 510 brush is my personal favorite for applying highlighter. </p>
            <p><strong>Eyebrows:</strong> The only thing you would use an eyebrow brush for is pomade. My favorite eyebrow brush is so cheap that it seems impossible that it would be such good quality. This brush has a perfectly angled tip with a spoolie on the other end, which saves y'all money on buying an extra brush. </p>
            <p><strong>Eyeshadow:</strong> One thing that everyone needs in their brush collection is a GOOD blending brush. Eyeshadow is an art of blending shadows together and without it, your look might end up looking muddled and messy. </p>
